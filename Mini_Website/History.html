      <h2>Early History</h2>
      <p>
        Caloocan City traces its roots to the pre-colonial period when it was a small 
        agricultural community. During the Spanish era, it became a strategic location 
        due to its proximity to Manila, playing an important role in trade and governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Revolutionary Role</h2>
      <p>
        The city became a focal point during the Philippine Revolution. Many Katipuneros 
        came from Caloocan, and it became one of the strongholds of the movement against 
        Spanish colonization. Its contributions to independence remain a source of pride 
        for its people.
