        <p>Known as the Father of the Philippine Revolution, 
            Bonifacio has strong connections to Caloocan where significant 
            Katipunan activities took place.</p>
            
        <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Why is Bonifacio Statue Located at Caloocan</h2>    
        <p>The iconic Andrés Bonifacio Monument is located in Caloocan, rather than his birthplace of Tondo, 
            because the monument marks the general vicinity where Bonifacio and the 
            Katipuneros gathered to begin the Philippine Revolution in 1896. 
            This historical location in Caloocan marks a pivotal moment in the nation's history, symbolizing the shift from peaceful reform to armed struggle against Spanish rule.</p>
